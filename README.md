# String Matching
String Matching algorithms try to find a place where one or several strings are found within a larger string or text.

Comparative study is done between three different String-matching algorithms:
Naive String matching algorithm,
Rabin-Karp algorithm and
Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.

Please note to change the file name for the string to be searched for.

If you want to use the 'A tale of two cities' as text then use A_Tale_of_Two_Cities.txt file

For DNA pattern as text use PCLA_cluster.txt
